- learning
- well right now im learning how github & git works, soon i'd like to get better at coding and using git/gitdesktop/obsidian. So far not too easy but it all comes with time. Enjoying this tutorial hopefully I can learn to translate all this into UX/UI design and working with the linccup team showing them i have what it takes. Enjoying the process yet dreading the patience but nothing ive ever wanted came easy.
